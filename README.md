woocommerce-language-packs
==========================

A small plugin for pulling in localization files for WooCommerce on demand.

@todo:


- [ ] System for checking if a locale exists for your WP LANG either on Tranifex or a different repo
- [ ] Support tags so that we can for instance pull in v2.2 of a language file if running 2.2
- [ ] System for pulling the langauge file into the wp languages folder - overwriting any that exist already
- [ ] Transient to make checks quick - wc_lang_version_{WC_VERSION}
- [ ] Admin notices when the current language files can be updated to a newer version
- [ ] Take langauges out of WC core and add this to the welcome page for 2.2
